I chose to generate a report based off the contact information as my additional report. It is easier to parse through the data from the database that way.

Directions/Steps:

1. Connect application to database with credentialed users.
2. Launch application
3. You will come to the login screen which tells you your current location and timezone.
4. Input your username (admin) and password (admin) if you are using the default
database “client_schedule”. The command to generate the database in a MySQL environment
is located in the DBGen.txt file in the main source.
5. Upon logging in, you will be greeted with a message that tells you if you have an
upcoming appointment within the next 15 minutes or not.
6. Once inside, you will come to the main screen for navigation. The choices are
Appointments, Customers, and Reports. You can choose one of the three.
7. If you choose Customers, you will be taken to the main Customers screen which shows
all of the current customers in the database. You have four choices on this main screen.
You can create a new customer, update an existing one, delete one, or you can choose to
go back to the main menu.
8. When you click on the Create Customer button, you will be taken to a screen that will
ask you for some information about the new customer. Upon clicking on the Save button,
the information will be saved to the database and you will be taken back to the main
screen. Your new customer will now be in the main display.
9. You can then choose to update a customer by clicking on the desired customer for
update turning the row blue. You will then click on the Update Customer button. Which
will take you to the Update Customer screen. Altering the information and saving will
change the information that is displayed in the main screen for Customers.
10. The choice to delete a customer is not one to be made lightly. You click on a
customer you would like to delete, and then click on the Delete Customer button. You
will be asked if you really want to. Clicking OK will delete the customer from the
database and the screen will change to reflect the change.
11. You can then click on the Back To Main Menu button to go back to the main menu.
12. If you choose Appointments, you will be taken to the main appointment view which
shows all of the appointments that were scheduled. You can filter through them by
clicking on the radio buttons close to the bottom of the screen by All Times, Week, or
Month You will also be able to Create a new appointment, Update an existing one, or
Delete one that you select. Selections are made by clicking on an appointment to make
it the active appointment. .
13. If you decide to create an appointment by clicking on the Create Appointment button,
you will be taken to a screen that asks you for some information to create it. This
information will be saved to the connected database when you click the Save button. You
will notice that the Appointment ID field is grayed out. This is because it is auto
generated by the database upon creation.
14. Saving will take you back to the Appointments main screen. If you choose to update
an appointment, you will need to click on one first. Then, click on the Update
Appointment button. This will then take you to the Update screen with all of the previous information from the main screen pre-loaded. You can then change any information that you would like to except for the appointment ID. Saving will take you back to the main Appointments screen.
15. You can delete an appointment by clicking on an appointment and clicking the Delete
button. The application will ask you if you really want to delete the appointment. If
you do, it will be gone forever. You have been warned.
16. If you choose the Reports path, you will be taken to the Reports screen which gives
you three types of reports to choose from for the appointments. The types are based off
of the information that is stored in the database to be compared against. The choices
are by the Type and Month, by the Contact information, and by the Customer Id.
17. You will make your choice and click the Generate button to see the report. The
formatting in this section is something to be desired, but is readable. I did the best
I could to format it the best that I could. This information can be copied and pasted
into somewhere like a notepad application for better readability.
18. Clicking on the Reset button clears the report out of the display pane.
19. Clicking on the Cancel button takes you back to the Main Menu.
20. You can then logout of the application, taking you back to the login screen.
21. You can click Cancel to close the application.
22. The login page is also able to be displayed in French based on the region settings
on your computer.
23. You can also see the appointments at different times based on your timezone.

There is a JavaDoc in the src file of the application that shows all of the information on the methods and other valuable information. Thank you for using my application!
